***** STEP BY STEP DESCRIPTION ***** 

The app consists of two activities: main and the contact editing activity. The main activity contains a scrollable list of contacts that are stored in a SQLite database. The user can click on any existing contact to edit or delete them, or the user can add a new contact by pressing on the floating action button. The database can also be reinitialized in the menu options. The contact editing activity consists of 10 fields: first name, last name, phone number, birth date, date of first contact, 2 address lines, city, state, and zip code. The save button will update existing contacts or create new contacts. The delete button will remove the contact. If the user shakes the device, their contact list will display in reverse. The "Map Address" option in the menu will display the contact's address in google maps.
